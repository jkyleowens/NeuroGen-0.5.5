Design Document: Modular Autonomous Learning Agent

1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a modular autonomous learning agent capable of operating a laptop by processing screen pixel data and controlling the mouse and keyboard. The agent's architecture is inspired by the modular structure of the human brain, featuring a network of specialized modules. Each module contains a sub-network of biologically plausible neurons organized into cortical columns. Synaptic connections within and between these modules will dynamically form and prune. The agent will be pre-trained on foundational tasks and will continuously learn and adapt through reinforcement learning as it interacts with the digital environment.

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and adaptive autonomous agent that can learn to perform a wide range of tasks on a computer, from simple file management to complex web Browse and data interaction, mirroring the learning process of a human user.

2. High-Level Architecture

The agent's architecture is fundamentally modular, reflecting the functional specialization observed in the cerebral cortex. This design offers several advantages, including improved learning efficiency, better generalization, and enhanced interpretability of the agent's internal states. Each module is a specialized neural network responsible for a distinct function.

The high-level architecture consists of the following interconnected core modules:

    Perception Module (Visual Cortex): Processes raw pixel data from the screen. üëÅÔ∏è

    Comprehension Module (Wernicke's & Broca's Areas): Interprets textual and symbolic information. üß†

    Executive Function Module (Prefrontal Cortex): Manages goals, plans, and coordinates the other modules. üß≠

    Memory Module (Hippocampus & Neocortex): Stores and retrieves short-term and long-term memories. üìö

    Central Controller Module (Neuromodulator Regulation): Regulates the overall state and learning rate of the network. ‚öôÔ∏è

    Output Module (Spike-to-Data Translation): Converts neural spike signals into digital commands for the computer. üñ±Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è

These modules are not isolated; their outputs are fed as inputs to other relevant modules, creating a dynamic and integrated system. For instance, the Perception Module's output, a structured representation of the visual scene, is sent to the Comprehension Module for interpretation and the Executive Function Module for decision-making. The Central Controller Module acts as a global regulator, influencing the activity of all other modules.

3. Modular Neural Network Architecture

Each module in the agent's architecture is a neural network with a specific role. The interconnectivity between these modules allows for complex, hierarchical processing of information.

3.1. Perception Module (Visual Cortex)

    Function: This module is responsible for processing the raw pixel data from the screen. It identifies and localizes key graphical user interface (GUI) elements such as buttons, text fields, icons, and windows.

    Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be used to extract spatial features from the screen captures. The output will be a feature map representing the objects and their locations on the screen, encoded as patterns of neural spikes.

3.2. Comprehension Module (Language & Symbol Interpretation)

    Function: This module receives the structured output from the Perception Module and interprets the textual and symbolic content. It understands the meaning of buttons, labels, and text on the screen.

    Architecture: This module will employ a combination of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text and a pre-trained language model to understand its semantic meaning. The interpreted information is then encoded into spike patterns.

3.3. Executive Function Module (Goal Management & Planning)

    Function: This is the central coordinator of the agent. It maintains the current goal (e.g., "find information on a specific topic"), breaks it down into sub-tasks (e.g., "open a web browser," "type in the search query"), and directs the other modules accordingly.

    Architecture: This module will be a reinforcement learning agent, likely using a policy network to decide which sub-task to execute next based on the current state of the environment (the screen).

3.4. Memory Module (Long-Term & Short-Term Storage)

    Function: This module stores and retrieves information. Short-term memory will hold the recent history of states, actions, and rewards for the reinforcement learning process. Long-term memory will store successful strategies and factual knowledge acquired from the internet or other sources.

    Architecture: Short-term memory will be implemented as a replay buffer. Long-term memory will use a knowledge base, potentially a graph database, to store structured information.

3.5. Central Controller Module (Neuromodulator Regulation)

    Function: This module acts as a global regulator, analogous to the brain's neuromodulatory systems (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine). It modulates the activity and learning rates of the other modules based on the overall state of the agent and the task at hand. For example, it can increase the learning rate in novel situations or suppress irrelevant module activity to maintain focus.

    Architecture: This will be a small, fully connected network that takes input from the Executive Function and Memory modules. Its output will be a set of neuromodulatory signals that influence the parameters (e.g., neuronal firing thresholds, synaptic plasticity rates) of the other modules.

3.6. Output Module (Spike-to-Data Translation)

    Function: This module is the final output pathway of the agent. It receives high-level action commands, represented as specific patterns and frequencies of neural spikes, from the Executive Function Module. Its primary role is to translate these abstract spike signals into concrete, digital data that the computer's operating system can understand.

    Architecture: A Spike-to-Rate converter followed by a simple decoder network will be used. The converter will translate the incoming spike trains into rate-based signals. The decoder will then map these rates to the specific parameters required for hardware control, such as (x, y) coordinates for mouse movements, click commands (left, right, double), and key press/release events for the keyboard.

4. Sub-Network Microarchitecture

A key innovation of this design is the microarchitecture of the sub-networks within each module, which emulates the structure of cortical columns in the brain.

4.1. Biologically Plausible Neurons

Instead of traditional artificial neurons (e.g., ReLU), each sub-network will utilize a custom, more biologically feasible neuron model. This model will incorporate properties of real neurons, such as:

    Spiking Behavior: Neurons will communicate through discrete events (spikes) rather than continuous values. The timing of these spikes will be a crucial element of information processing. A Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model is a suitable starting point.

    Dendritic Computation: The neuron's dendrites will perform initial processing of incoming signals, allowing for more complex computations within a single neuron.

4.2. Cortical Columns

The neurons within each sub-network will be organized into highly interconnected cortical columns. A cortical column is a small, vertically organized group of neurons that forms a fundamental computational unit.

    Connectivity: Neurons within a column will be densely interconnected, fostering rapid, localized information processing.

    Function: Each column will be tuned to detect specific features or patterns relevant to the module's function (e.g., a column in the Perception Module might be sensitive to horizontal edges).

5. Synaptic Dynamics: Dynamic Formation and Pruning

The synapses, or connections between neurons, will not be static. They will be created and eliminated based on the principles of synaptic plasticity, mirroring the brain's ability to learn and adapt.

    Synapse Formation: New synaptic connections will be probabilistically formed between neurons. The likelihood of a new synapse forming between two neurons will be inversely proportional to the physical distance between them within the network's simulated 3D space.

    Synaptic Pruning: Existing synapses will be pruned (removed) based on their utility. Synapses that are infrequently used or that do not contribute to successful outcomes will be weakened and eventually eliminated. This process is guided by a "use it or lose it" principle, which can be implemented using a Hebbian learning rule modulated by the reinforcement learning signal.

This dynamic rewiring allows the agent's neural architecture to self-organize and adapt to new tasks and environments.

6. Learning and Adaptation

The agent's learning process will be two-fold: initial pre-training followed by continuous reinforcement learning.

6.1. Pre-training

The agent will be pre-trained on a large dataset of recorded human computer interactions. This will provide a foundational understanding of common GUI elements, user behaviors, and task structures. This initial training will primarily shape the weights of the Perception and Comprehension modules.

6.2. Continuous Reinforcement Learning

After pre-training, the agent will learn autonomously through reinforcement learning.

    Reward Signal: The agent will receive a reward signal based on its performance on tasks. For example, successfully navigating to a specific website or finding a piece of information would generate a positive reward. The reward function will be carefully designed to encourage exploration and task completion.

    Exploration: The agent will use an exploration strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy or more sophisticated methods) to try new actions and discover novel solutions.

    Self-Correction: The agent will learn from its mistakes. Actions that lead to negative outcomes (e.g., closing the wrong window) will result in a negative reward, discouraging the agent from repeating those actions.

    LLM-Assisted Training: The agent can query Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level guidance or to generate potential solutions to novel problems, accelerating its learning process. The LLM's suggestions can be used to shape the agent's exploration strategy.

7. Input/Output Systems

    Input: The agent's primary input will be a continuous stream of pixel data from the laptop's screen. This data will be captured at a regular frame rate and fed into the Perception Module.

    Output: The agent's output will be commands to the operating system's mouse and keyboard drivers. The Output Module will generate the digital data for these commands (e.g., x-y coordinates for a mouse click, key codes for keyboard input) by translating the spike signals from the network.
